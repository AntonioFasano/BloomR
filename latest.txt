1.3.6

R version 3.3.2 (2016-10-31) -- "Sincere Pumpkin Patch"

This release implements automatic Github publication, via Github release API.  
This will be particularly useful for those "mechanical releases", where it is only necessary to update the R version or similar trivial, non-thought tasks.

Dev features
bloomr.build has been radically rewritten
bloomr.release: new code intended for automatic releases, provided you have the auth tokens.
